# CRUD-go

## Overview
based on my research, I want to give go-lang a try to build out a CRUD back end in Go-Lang

## Getting Started
1. Install Go Language site: https://go.dev/doc/install
```normally I would put together a step-by-step but uh go lang's site is good enough```
2. Install postgres: https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/debian/
```I run debian but you can choose a different OS```
```also you may choose a different database to interact with```
